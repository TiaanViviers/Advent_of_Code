# Advent of Code

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! üéÑ‚ú®

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges, a series of fun and creative programming puzzles released every December. While solving these puzzles, I aim to:

- **Experiment with new languages**: Learn by doing, using languages I'm exploring or curious about.
- **Sharpen my problem-solving skills**: Tackle challenges that push my boundaries and encourage creative thinking.
- **Have fun**: This is as much about the journey as it is about the destination. I don‚Äôt always aim for optimal solutions‚Äîsometimes it's just about making it work!

## Languages Used

Here‚Äôs a list of languages I‚Äôve used in this repository so far:
- **Python**: My preffered Langue for string processing, Data Science and ML. Used in AOC 2023.
- **Mojo**: Experimenting with this new and exciting language for Advent of Code 2024.

## How to Run the Solutions

Feel free to use any of my solutions, just leave a star on the repo! ‚≠ê
Each day's solution is organized into its own directory (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`). Instructions for running the solutions vary depending on the language, but here are some general guidelines:
- your input file is provided as a command line argument.
- make sure you have all packages/libraries and dependancies installed to run the code.

## Notes

- Not all solutions are perfect! Some are quick-and-dirty hacks to get the star.
- Solutions might improve over time as I revisit puzzles and optimize my code.
- Feel free to share feedback, suggestions, or your own solutions!

Happy coding! üéâ
